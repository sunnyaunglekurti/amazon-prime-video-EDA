# 🎬 Amazon Prime Video EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon Prime Video dataset to uncover insights about its content library — including genres, release years, actors, countries, and content distribution.

The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset to better understand the streaming platform’s catalog and provide meaningful business insights.




## highlights



* Cleaned and consolidated dataset (handled duplicates, missing values, multi-valued    columns like actors/genres, with total 9k titles.).

* Applied machine learning–based imputation (KNN imputer) to handle missing values.

* Visualized trends in genres, movies vs TV shows, release years, and top countries.

* Built insights with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
## project objective


The goal of this project is to analyze Amazon Prime Video’s content library to identify trends and patterns that can support content strategy and decision-making.
this analysis aims to provide data-driven insights for understanding customer preferences and platform growth.
## Key Hightlights

* 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Rigorous cleaning process to ensure data integrity.

Addressed missing values (using KNN Imputer / Mean / Mode / Median where applicable).

Unnested comma-separated columns (actors, genres, countries).

* 🎞️ Content Analysis

Explored diversity and categorization of content.

Identified hidden patterns in genres, release years, ratings.

* 👥 User Interactions

Analyzed reviews, sentiments, or engagement trends.

Explored viewing preferences and behavior.

* 📊 Data Visualization

Used Matplotlib ,Seaborn and plotly to create compelling charts.
## 📂 Dataset 

Source: 

Size: ~9,000 titles

Columns: Show ID, Title, Type, Director, Cast, Country, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Genre, Date Added
## Key/Insights
📈 Results 

 Movies dominate the catalog

* Around X% of titles are movies compared to TV shows.
  
  Amazon Prime is positioning itself more as a movie-centric platform, which could be leveraged in partnerships with film producers and distributors.


* Rapid content growth after 2015
   
   Maintaining this pace with regional original productions can help Prime compete with Netflix and Disney+, especially in emerging markets.


* Regional dominance – U.S., India, and U.K.
    
  Amazon can focus on content localization and partnerships with regional creators in   Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia to accelerate global subscriber growth.


* Ratings skew towards family-friendly content

  A large share of the catalog is rated for general/family audiences.
  adding more mature/adult-oriented originals could attract young adult audiences, balancing the portfolio.
  

* Movies dominate over TV shows

  The majority of content on Prime Video consists of movies rather than series.
  While movies bring quick engagement, expanding original TV shows could increase long-term subscriber retention, since series encourage binge-watching and recurring usage.


* Top-rated shows are hidden gems

  some highly rated movies and series receive less visibility on the platform.
  Amazon should invest in marketing campaigns and improve content discovery algorithms to surface these hidden gems, maximizing ROI on existing content.


  



----------------Learnings from this Project--------------------------------

  * Improved handling of multi-valued categorical data (actors, genres, countries).

  * Gained hands-on experience with KNN imputer for ML-based missing value treatment.

   * Enhanced data storytelling skills by connecting EDA results to business strategy.
